1. Improve classification performance
    a. Balance class weights before classification
    b. Add features by percent and ATR
    c. Add market features
    d. Use feature selection stage before feature clustering
    e. Evaluate if statistical feature selection gives better performance
2. Add precision, recall and F1 scores to Hyperparameter optimization stage report
3. Strategy evaluation pre and post meta-labeling
4. Strategy discovery using the decision trees over features found
5. Create ClassiefierRule that loads the model and provides the classification.
6. At startup, mae and mfe values for all positions must be updated for trailing stop to work
7. Develop Long Breakout strategy with fat tails for manual trading
8. Create indicators:
    a. TickIndicator - MarketBreadthIndicator
    b. MarketMoneyIndicator
    d. VOLDIndicator - MarketVolumeIndicator
    e. ShockIndicator
    f. RejectionIndicator
    g. DeltaIndicator
    h. WeightedEnsembleIndicator
    i. VolatilityContractionIndicator - RSI(StdDev)

    ADX, Aroon, KAMA, Laguerre, CCI



Improvements for future:
1. Portfolio construction using un-correlated strategies with non-overlapping positions
2. Positing queueing and ranking using model confidence
3. Capital allocation using model confidence
