Steps for creating a trading strategy:

1. Define a bare minimum entry signal and exit after fixed number of bars.
2. Generate a tsv file for signal parameters as features and average MFE as target.
2. Select entry signal parameters for maximum average MFE, use Orange for visualization.
3. Generate tsv feature file with all the features and average MFE as target.
4. Use Orange to rank all features using Mutual Information. Select top n features that make sense.
5. Create a feature group specifically for these selected features.
6. For each hyperparameter set,
    Train RandomForest classifier on training set.
    Test RandomForest on test set.
    Calculate Robustness Score = (Ptrain - Ptest)/Abs(Ptrain - Ptest)
7. Create a tsv with hyperparameters as features and above metric as target variable.
8. Use Orange to visualize and select most robust hyperparameter set maximizing this metric.
9. Optimize different exit signals with different parameters using Optimizer. (for RARBADD)
10. Validate this final trading strategy with MonteCarlo - Position permutation




Create ClassiefierRule that loads the model and provides the classification.


Improvements for future:
1. Portfolio construction using un-correlated strategies with non-overlapping positions
2. Positing queueing and ranking using LTR algorithms
3. Capital allocation using LTR algorithms
4. Evaluate if Weighted RandomForest provides better results
5. Evaluate if stacking, boosting of RandomForest provides better results





1. All Indicators must implement onTick method, FloatSeries to implement set method.
This required so that the indicator values are available during the bar, not just at close of the bar.
Caller should call onTick method for every tick, while onBar method must be called only when the bar is changed.
PreviousValueIndicator and other indicators which store the past values, will set the delegate indicator value in series.
(This will need FloatSeries to implement set() method that allows overwriting current value, instead of inserting in new slot)
When onBar method is called the indicator will add the delegate indicator value to the series.

2. At startup, mae and mfe values for all positions must be updated for trailing stop to work
