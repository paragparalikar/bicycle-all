1. All Indicators must implement onTick method, FloatSeries to implement set method.
This required so that the indicator values are available during the bar, not just at close of the bar.
Caller should call onTick method for every tick, while onBar method must be called only when the bar is changed.
PreviousValueIndicator and other indicators which store the past values, will set the delegate indicator value in series.
(This will need FloatSeries to implement set() method that allows overwriting current value, instead of inserting in new slot)
When onBar method is called the indicator will add the delegate indicator value to the series.

2. At startup, mae and mfe values for all positions must be updated for trailing stop to work
