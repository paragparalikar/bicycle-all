Steps for creating a trading strategy:

1. Define a bare minimum entry signal and exit after fixed number of bars.
2. Optimize entry signal for maximum average MFE.
3. Collect features in separate feature files for each type of feature group.
4. Perform transpose + hierarchical clustering.
5. Rank features using Information Gain / Lasso regression.
6. Select features with the highest spearman correlation with MFE from each cluster.
7. Build an ensemble trading strategy with features select for each feature group.
8. Optimize the strategy for threshold values in ensemble to maximize average MFE.
9. Optimize the strategy exit rules to maximize RAR/ADD.
10. Verify the strategy's performance and robustness.






Rank symbols based on:
1. Average standard deviation / close
2. Average spread / close
3. Average efficiency
4. Average volume
5. Average turnover






1. All Indicators must implement onTick method, FloatSeries to implement set method.
This required so that the indicator values are available during the bar, not just at close of the bar.
Caller should call onTick method for every tick, while onBar method must be called only when the bar is changed.
PreviousValueIndicator and other indicators which store the past values, will set the delegate indicator value in series.
(This will need FloatSeries to implement set() method that allows overwriting current value, instead of inserting in new slot)
When onBar method is called the indicator will add the delegate indicator value to the series.

2. At startup, mae and mfe values for all positions must be updated for trailing stop to work




direct - rising-strength(rsi(close,20),20)                  means uptrend
inverse - (variance(close,30) / variance(close,120))        means low volatility
inverse - (ema(volume,30) / ema(volume,120))                means oversold region
direct - ibs                                                means headed upward
